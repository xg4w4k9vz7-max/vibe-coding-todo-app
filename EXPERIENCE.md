## Tool Selection Justification

I chose **Cursor** as the vibe coding tool for this project because it is an AI-first code editor that works directly inside the development environment. Its ability to understand the full project context and respond to natural language commands made it appealing for building a small but complete application efficiently.

Cursor also allows the developer to stay in control by reviewing and approving AI-generated changes, which helped maintain confidence in the correctness and structure of the code.

## Development Process

During development, I used Cursor as an AI pair programmer. I started by asking it to generate a basic Todo application structure using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. After establishing the base structure, I iteratively added features such as task deletion and data persistence.

Effective prompts included instructions like “add localStorage support” and “simplify the JavaScript logic.” The development process required multiple iterations, especially to refine the user interface and ensure the application behaved correctly after page reloads.

## Challenges and Solutions

One of the main challenges was ensuring that tasks were saved and restored correctly using localStorage. Although the AI generated an initial solution, I reviewed and adjusted the logic to make sure data was handled reliably.

Another challenge was styling the interface to look clean and readable. Cursor helped suggest basic CSS improvements, but final adjustments required manual testing and minor refinements.

## Reflection

What surprised me most about vibe coding was how much it shifted my focus from syntax to intent. Instead of thinking line by line, I could describe what I wanted to achieve and let the tool assist with implementation.

I would use vibe coding tools again for future projects, especially during prototyping or individual assignments. However, I believe it is important to understand the underlying code to avoid over-reliance on AI. Overall, this experience demonstrated how vibe coding can enhance productivity while still requiring critical developer involvement.
